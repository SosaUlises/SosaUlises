# Hi there 👋 I'm Ulises Sosa

Backend Developer focused on the .NET ecosystem.

I'm an Information Systems Analyst and an advanced Systems Engineering student.  
I specialize in building well-structured backend applications using ASP.NET Core and applying architectural principles that prioritize maintainability, clarity, and scalability.

I approach development with a strong focus on clean code, separation of concerns, and long-term system evolution.
